shadermagic
provides a nicer interface for loading opengl shaders than what's included with opengl, and a simple macro language for common things like loading textures, setting up FBOs and using glsl libraries


you'll need SDL2 to compile the example program, but any library that gives you an opengl ~3.2 context should work for creating your own


compile the example program under linux with
gcc -g main.c -o main `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lGL
